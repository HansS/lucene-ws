CreateIndex.java README:
========================

This program pulls rows of data from a PostgreSQL database and indexes them into
a lucene index.

To compile and run this program, you will need to have the following items in your
CLASSPATH environment variable:

CLASSPATH must include:
   ../build/WEB-INF/classes
   lucene-1.4-final.jar
   postgresql.jar

Then, you will need to go through the source code to add the needed SQL queries and
field defintions. Search for TODO in the source code to find places that need attention.
