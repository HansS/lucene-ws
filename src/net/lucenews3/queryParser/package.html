		<p>Implements a visitor pattern model for the Lucene query parser.</p>
		
		<p>Suppose there exists an application which accepts user query strings and parses
			them using the Lucene query parser. Suppose the user searches for the string
			"Lord of the Rings". Internally, the application parses this string using
			"title" as the default field. Assuming a StandardAnalyzer is used, the Lucene
			query parser will produce a query object whose textual representation is now
			"title:lord title:rings".</p>
		
		<p>The initial purpose of this package was to develop a query parser which produces
			queries that contain references to the original text that created them.</p>
		
		<p>It was thought that a subclass of QueryParser would be suitable. Subclasses would
			be able to override the various get*Query methods (see QueryParser Javadoc) and
			use <code>getToken(int)</code> to determine the parsing token which created
			the current query.</p>
		
		<p>Although this practice worked well initially, it was seen that the ability to turn
			the QueryParser into a pipe-and-filter mechanism would prove too
			difficult. This eliminated the possibility of having filtered QueryParser objects.</p>
		
		<p>The <code>QueryParser</code> class invokes protected methods as it parses
			text. These protected methods are of the general form
			<code>get[type]Query(...)</code> where <code>[type]</code> represents
			the various categories of category (e.g. - fuzzy, term, field, boolean). All
			such methods return <code>Query</code> objects.</p>
