Lucene Web Service
------------------

DESCRIPTION

The Lucene Web Service is a REST-compliant Java servlet capable of searching and
managing multiple Lucene indices via the web. It is built upon the Atom Publishing
Protocol and conforms to the OpenSearch 1.1 standard.

BUILDING

To build the Lucene Web Service you can use ant with the build.xml that is included.

INSTALLING

Configure the web service by editing web.xml in the conf directory. Most of the default
settings should be ok, but you will need to change the indices.directories init-param to 
specify the directories where you want Lucene indexes to reside.

Setting:               Description:
===============================================================================================
   
properties-file        When present in initial parameters, service will replace all initial
                       parameters with those contained within the file pointed to by the value.
                          
service.title          The title of service. Defaults to "Lucene Web Service vX.X.X"
                          
service.defaultfield   Provides a global default field to be used when searching. This value is
                       only used as a last resort.
                          
indices.directories    A comma-delimited list of directories within which will reside the indices.
                       Left-most directories have higher priority than right-most. New indices 
                       are created in the left-most directory.
                          
service.debugging      If true, a stack trace is appended to all exceptions thrown, providing
                       valuable information.
